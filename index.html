            <h3>Warnock for GA</h3>
            </section>
            <article class="campaign-description-container">
                <p>The Man: Warnock is the youngest pastor to lead from MLK, Jr.'s pulpit. He has excellent policy stances, which is reflected in broad endorsements from the DSCC and BradyPac to the progressive: NARAL Pro Choice, End Citizens United, and Democracy for America. He's a justice warrior and proud ally to the LGBTQ+ community, all in the deep south. We could fill pages why Warnock may be the best person we support. But our representative democracy is 2.5 centuries behind electing Black leaders. With someone like Warnock need we say more?</p>

                <p>The Race: Warnock runs in a special election against four others. If one candidate gets 50% of votes, they will be seated this Nov. Otherwise, the top two winners will have a run-off in January where the entire nation of decent Americans will rally around Warnock's win. Just today, polls show him surging into first place; he may just nab the 50% in Nov. And if not, he will definitely make the runoff. A Warnock win unseats Kelly Loeffler, the very Senator who told America not to worry about COVID in February while secretly dumping her vulnerable stock holdings. She is a criminal.</p>
                
                <p>•Giving Impact: Our support in GA has huge ballot impact on: (i) two Senate races (Warnock / Ossoff); and (ii) major opportunities to win flippable state chambers with an excellent slate of local female candidates, including many Black women. These winnable races aren't getting the national coverage they need, which is why 46P will bring our might.</p>

            <h3>Black-led GOTV Fund 
            <h3 class="description-text">Donations Matched!</span> </h3>
            </section>  
            <article class="campaign-description-container">
                <p>•This is an umbrella fund by Movement Voter Project that supports a group of vetted, unassailable, results-driven Black-led voter mobilization efforts in battleground states. Below the signature block there's a link with more on each group that benefits from our support. That site could never convey the personal impression you'd get hearing directly from these tireless, courageous activists proverbially knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors across America.</p>

                <p>46P has a huge opportunity to double our grassroots impact this week. A fellow alum from Vassar offered a $150,000 match at an event we co-hosted Tues for Movement Voter Project. It was a huge success but those funds have not been exhausted. He's generously agreed to match our gives to the Black-led GOT Org. Please consider reporting amounts to me if you give here so I can update 46Ps weekly totals. </p>
